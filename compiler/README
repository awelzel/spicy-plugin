This library implements all code generation & compilation for
interfacing Spicy with Zeek. It's independent of having a Zeek process
itself available, everything that requires having access to Zeek
itself is out of scope. This way, this library will later be able to
support a standalone compiler tool that outputs C++ code for static
compilation.
